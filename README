This is a fairly simple little web application. It was designed using the Catalyst
MVC framework for Perl. All you have to do is run script/start_server.pl to start it up
in test mode so you can get a feel for how it works, etc. 

The meat of this project is a large javascript file, root/static/js/load.js, which 
initializes all of the necessary information for the display. The frontend is all
designed using the Ext javascript library, version 4.0.0.
